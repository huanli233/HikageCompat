## What's this

`Hikage` (Pronunciation /Ààh…™k…ëÀê…°e…™/), this is an Android responsive UI build tool designed to focus on **Real-time code building UI**.

The project icon was designed by [MaiTungTM](https://github.com/Lagrio),
the name is taken from the original song "Haru**hikage**" in "BanG Dream It's MyGO!!!!!".

</details>

Unlike Jetpack Compose's declarative UI, Hikage focuses on Android native platforms,
and its design goal is to enable developers to quickly build UIs and directly support Android native components.

**<u>Hikage is just a UI build tool and does not provide any UI components themselves</u>**.

Rejecting duplicate wheels, our solution is always compatible and efficient. Now you can abandon ViewBinding and XML and even `findViewById` and try
to use the code layout directly.

`Hikage` works better with another project [BetterAndroid](https://github.com/BetterAndroid/BetterAndroid) and
`Hikage` itself will automatically reference the `BetterAndroid` related dependencies as the core content.

## About this fork
This fork makes non-Compose modules compatible with API 14 and fixes some issues and adds some features.

- Improved State
- Use view Attributes defined in XML (Just add an attribute to the root View of any layout file and specify it through the attr parameter)
- Cached AttributeSet, reduce reflections
- Fix LayoutParams wrapper not working properly for ConstraintLayout or some other layouts
- Aliases for some functions
- Improved string id and int id mapping
